# Getting Started with VSCode, Markdown, and LaTex

### Objective
The objective of this document is to introduce VSCode, Markdown, and LaTex for Georgia Tech ECE students. By the end of this document, you will be able to install and configure VSCode, format a document using both VSCode and LaTex using common commands.

### Background
When I started ECE3057, I was asked to complete all of my lab documents using LaTex and Markdown. Having never used either languages, I was tasked with learning both the content for the class and how to setup my environment and format my documents using Markdown and LaTex.

I have created this document in hopes that it will help future students navigate Markdown and LaTex without having to search all over to find examples. This document will also as a cheat sheet for when students forget the commands they need.
