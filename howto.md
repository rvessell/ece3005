# Getting Started with VSCode, Markdown, and LaTex

### Objective
The objective of this document is to introduce VSCode, Markdown, and LaTex for Georgia Tech ECE students. By the end of this document, you will be able to install and configure VSCode, format a document using both VSCode and LaTex using common commands.

### Background
When I started ECE3057, I was asked to complete all of my lab documents using LaTex and Markdown. Having never used either languages, I was tasked with learning both the content for the class and how to setup my environment and format my documents using Markdown and LaTex.

I have created this document in hopes that it will help future students navigate Markdown and LaTex without having to search all over to find examples. This document will also as a cheat sheet for when students forget the commands they need.

## Setting Up VSCode
//install here

After you have installed VSCode, I recommend installing the following extensions.

"Mardown PDF"

Once installed, there are two key features you will want to know how to access.

Preview
Since you will want to see what your out looks like before you export to PDF, you will want to open the preview window.

- First press **CTL+SHIFT+P** and type "**Markdown: Open Preview to the Side**" and hit enter. This will open a window for you to the side that will show all of your formatted text as you type it.

Export to PDF
Once you are done writing your document, you will want to export that document, this can be done using

- First press **CTL+SHIFT+P** and type "**Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)**" and hit enter. Once the export is complete, you will have a PDF version of your document in the same directory as your Markdown file.
